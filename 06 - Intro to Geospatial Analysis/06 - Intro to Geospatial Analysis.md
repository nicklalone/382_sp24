# <a id="reading"></a>Reading for this week
Not a lot of readings this week. I had initially intended to do an exercise and go over Open Street Map but we'll move that back to disaster. Instead, I wanted to provide a few videos that are worthy of your attention. 

* [How to Perform Hydrology Analysis and Flood Risk Mapping in ArcGIS? A Complete Tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DVVihogMQ0&ab_channel=HealthGIS)
* [Geospatial Analysis for Retailers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol0SvsF2kP0&ab_channel=CARTO)
* [Spatial Analysis with ArcGIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOPpQicK3Hg&ab_channel=ArcGIS)
* [Traffic Data Analysis in GIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEC37x04tcw&list=PLGZUzt4E4O2KQz9IxGKrEyKB8rA0UVx1W&ab_channel=ArcGIS)
* [Spatial Data Analysis and Its Role in GIS](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/spatial-data-analysis-what-its-role-gis-vladimir-ovramenko#:~:text=Geospatial%20analysis%20plays%20an%20important,public%20health%20in%20various%20areas.)

Each one of these videos could be an entire course. If you're interested in this sort of thing, dig on in!

* Geospatial Analysis - a form of computational analysis that uses geographic information, spatial data, location data, and increasingly, high-resolution imagery, computer vision, and other forms of AI to extract structured data that can be used for specific applications and industries.

# <a id = "day1"></a>Day 1 - Geospatial Analysis: What it is, what it does
The basis of GIS from ESRI is Google Maps + Excel at its most basic. However, what this comparison provides is incomplete. To make it more complete, we can say that GIS is _actually_ Google Maps + Excel + the Python Interpreter. 

You may wonder how and why Python is involved here and we won't specifically get into this in this course. Instead, we will discuss analyses that have been performed using the full breadth and depth of GIS and talk a little bit about how and what went into those analyses. 

For the most part, I have tried to grab a higher level analysis that has data that is available and with the help of a whole lot of tutorials, you could begin an analysis. First and foremost, at least for my time as a sort-of geospatial analyst, we tend to use the data from the United States Census. 

Collecting data is enormously expensive and any decisions to study something has to begin with finding or collecting it in some capacity. Here are a few fun repositories:

## Examples of Geospatial Analysis
From examining travel patterns in a municipality to trying to figure out where a new Starbucks or Target could go, there is an enormous amount of information out there that folks can crunch to figure this stuff out. We'll briefly go over a few of those things.
