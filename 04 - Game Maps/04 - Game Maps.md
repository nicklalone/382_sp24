# <a id="reading"></a>Reading for this week
This week, you're reading things based on my ego (i'm kidding). You are reading things based on a project my research group has manifested. Surprisingly, the GIS folks thought it was neat? So, I thought it would be fun!

Toups Dugas, Phoebe O., et al. "Making maps available for play: analyzing the design of game cartography interfaces." _ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction (TOCHI)_ 26.5 (2019): 1-43.|

# <a id = "today"></a>Concepts for This Week 
* Game Cartography Interface - An interface that affords users the ability to manipulate geographic data.
* Playful Mapping - Taking concepts from games and using them in similar ways with actual geographic information.
* Maps of Fictional Places - All maps are essentially maps of fictional places as in reality we need to be there to carry forward the idea of reality. That said, a map is often one artifact that is essential for making a place feel more real.
* Avalon Hill - This is a company that was essential for the development of both Dungeons and Dragons but also maps for tabletop games and really just popular culture mapping. 
* Outdoor Survival - This is a game that isn't really a game. Instead, it was a best seller because the first edition of Dungeons and Dragons recommended its purchase for the map it contained.
* Dungeons and Dragons - This is a game that matches imaginary play developed across the decades of war and the World Wars with individual, officer rules for games that began being developed after the battles of Jena and Auerstadt. Strategos, developed by an American, is the US version of another game called Kriegspiel.
* Play on Map - When we began working on games and developing video games, the most logical thing was to work on the map that was included in the box with games. 
* Draw Map on Paper - Eventually, we began to hide the map and play involved drawing it while exploration was happening.
* 3D and Maps - As games developed a z-axis, we began to be able to create terrain that was 3dimensional. To deal with this, we began to import developments of maps from the outside.
# <a id = "day1"></a>Day 1 - The Deal

The biggest deal of anything that we'll talk about today can be broken into a very neat and tidy set of 3. 
1. Maps come from war.
2. The games now we play come from war.
3. Everything is disconnected from war now but games, computers, and maps are interconnected and reinforce each other as one of them changes.

The basics of the deal are this (in chronological order): 
1. Napoleon's conquest of Europe
2. Acceleration of military intelligence 
3. Kriegspiel / Strategos are written 
4. Better maps and mapping
5. Digital approach to maps
6. Epochs of tying maps and games
	1. Board games / Wargames / D&D
	2. Text Adventures
	3. Mapping manually
	4. Playing on maps
	5. Map detaches / 3D
	6. Re-alignment of GPS/GIS and Games
	7. AR/VR >>>> coming soon.
