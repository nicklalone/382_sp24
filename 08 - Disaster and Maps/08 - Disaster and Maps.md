ESRI's Deal: 
		1. https://www.esri.com/en-us/disaster-response/overview
		
There are a few givens to consider with regard to maps and disaster. We will state these givens now: 

1. We refer to the event that creates the disaster a hazard. These hazards can be natural, manmade, and technological.
2. Disasters begin long before the hazard. 
3. Vulnerability and risk are not equal across the population. 

But what does this have to do with maps? 

1. 3 Kinds of Maps

We can say that there are 3 kinds of maps we have for disaster. Those maps are: 

1. A Map of the Local Area.
City planning is a process that does not check in with emergency management. The reason this matters is that most of your vulnerabilities and weaknesses originate here.

Why?

2. A Map of Risk and Vulnerability.

What is risk?

Does this matter?

Let's talk about the following image:

What does this mean?

But don't take my word for it.
