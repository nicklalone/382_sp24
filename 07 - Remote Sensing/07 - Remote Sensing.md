1. **What is remote sensing?**  

Remote sensing is the process of detecting and monitoring the physical characteristics of an area by measuring its reflected and emitted radiation at a distance (typically from satellite or aircraft).([USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-remote-sensing-and-what-it-used#%3A%7E%3Atext%3DRemote%20sensing%20is%20the%20process%2Ctypically%20from%20satellite%20or%20aircraft)))

Remote sensing is the acquiring of information from a distance.([NASA](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/backgrounders/remote-sensing))

Remote sensing is defined as the measurement of object properties on the earth’s surface using data acquired from aircrafts and satellites.([Remote sensing: Models and](https://books.google.com/books?id=KQXNaDH0X-IC&pg=PA2%23v%3Donepage&q&f=false) [methods for image Processing](https://books.google.com/books?id=KQXNaDH0X-IC&pg=PA2%23v%3Donepage&q&f=false))

1. **What is Active remote sensing?**

“The sensor emits radiation which is directed toward the target to be investigated. The radiation reflected from that target is detected and measured by the sensor.” ([Gov of](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/maps-tools-publications/satellite-imagery-air-photos/remote-sensing-tutorials/introduction/passive-vs-active-sensing/14639) [Canada](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/maps-tools-publications/satellite-imagery-air-photos/remote-sensing-tutorials/introduction/passive-vs-active-sensing/14639))

“Active Sensors have their own source of light or illumination. In particular, it actively sends a pulse and measures the backscatter reflected to the sensor.” ([GIS Geography](https://gisgeography.com/passive-active-sensors-remote-sensing/))

Active sensors use internal stimuli to collect data, emitting energy in order to scan objects and areas whereupon a sensor measures the energy reflected from the target. RADAR and LiDAR are typical active remote sensing tools that measure the time delay between emission and return in order to establish the location, direction, and speed of an object. The remote sensing data gathered is then processed and analyzed with remote sensing hardware and computer software, which is available in a variety of proprietary and open source applications.([Heavy.AI](https://www.heavy.ai/technical-glossary/remote-sensing))

4. **What is Passive remote sensing?** 

“Remote sensing systems which measure energy that is naturally available are called passive sensors. Passive sensors can only be used to detect energy when the naturally occurring energy is available. For all reflected energy, this can only take place during the time when the sun is illuminating the Earth.” ([Gov of Canada](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/maps-tools-publications/satellite-imagery-air-photos/remote-sensing-tutorials/introduction/passive-vs-active-sensing/14639))

Passive sensors respond to external stimuli, gathering radiation that is reflected or emitted by an object or the surrounding space. The most common source of radiation measured by passive remote sensing is reflected sunlight. Popular examples of passive remote sensors include charge-coupled devices, film photography, radiometers, and infrared. ([Heavy.AI](https://www.heavy.ai/technical-glossary/remote-sensing))

“Passive sensors measure reflected sunlight emitted by the sun. When the sun shines passive sensors measure this energy In terms of passive remote sensing, the

Landsat mission is the longest running earth observation program. For over 40 years, Landsat has collected and documented our changing planet. Landsat science helps understand Earth’s climate, ecosystem and land use.” ([GIS Geography](https://gisgeography.com/passive-active-sensors-remote-sensing/))

*  **2 Web Resources,**

	1. Passive remote sensing detects energy emitted from an object. Most passive systems operate in the visible, infrared, thermal infrared, and microwave portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. These include sensors such as Accelerometers, Radiometers, and Spectrometers. ([NASA Earthdata](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/backgrounders/passive-sensors))
	2.  [Passive vs Active Sensing,](https://gisgeography.com/passive-active-sensors-remote-sensing/#%3A%7E%3Atext%3DActive%20sensors%20have%20their%20own%20source%20of%20light%2Cthe%20sun%20shines%2C%20passive%20sensors%20measure%20this%20energy) Passive sensors use naturally emitted light from the sun. Without the sun, there wouldn’t be passive remote sensing.

In the visible to shortwave infrared, the radiation collected by a remote sensing system originates with the sun…In the thermal infrared, [thermal radiation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/thermal-radiation) is emitted directly by materials on the earth and combines with self-emitted thermal radiation in the atmosphere as it propagates upward.”
1.  [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/general/what-are-passive-and-active-sensors/) “Spaceborne passive sensors provide the ability to obtain all-weather, day and night, global observations of the Earth and its atmosphere.”

6. **What kind of data does remote sensing include?**

Remote sensing can include any physical characteristic, such as; temperature, distance, size, elevation, terrain, vegetative properties, cloud cover, water body depth, bedrock depth, & Gravimetry. Specialized sensors can go further and determine the chemical makeup of certain materials. ([USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-remote-sensing-and-what-it-used))

7. **In what circumstances are feet a remote sensor? In an earthquake, when the floor is wet, detecting temperature changes, finding where the floor is(uneven surface)**

Feet have three primary sensory receptors: Mechanoreceptors, which can detect pressure and vibrations, Thermoreceptors, which can detect and regulate temperature, and Nociceptors, which detect pain. Ergo, in situations involving vibrations, temperature, or pain, feet can function as remote sensors. ([I didn’t make this up.](https://www.medboundtimes.com/fitness-and-wellness/perceiving-the-world-through-your-feet))

8. **If I were to design a remote sensor for some phenomenon, what would that thing be tasked at sensing?**

Remote sensors often have the capacity to measure wavelengths of light or sound that are reflected off of the subject or area being observed. This device should have an emitter and a receptor. Lidar, lasers, and sonar are prime examples of how we use waves to measure distance from a point. Using distances, we can accurately make a textured surface that models the area or subject that was observed.

In the case of an evacuation, we could design a remote sensor to measure the amount of sound coming from stairways to determine the most available path out of a particular building.

9. **Why is it needed?**

Remote sensing is needed to detect phenomena is advance to give as much warning time as possible in the event it is needed (ie. evacuation.) Remote sensing is also useful in gathering information about a subject from very far away or without touching it.([USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-remote-sensing-and-what-it-used))

10. **So** **I** **have** **asked** **a** **class** **of** **30** **individuals** **(of** **which** **around** **10** **will** **have** **actively contributed** **to** **this** **task)** **for** **solid** **answers** **about** **what** **remote** **sensing** **is.** **What weaknesses could there be in the data feed from my remote sensors?**

Disjointed data, as the remote sensors aren’t fully communicating as they collect data. Face value information is being used for the answers instead of thorough research

Most people will not be fact checking the information so it only takes one or two people to screw up the grade of everybody else

The data being gathered is not representative of the whole population or the understanding of the whole class – it will only be representative of the contributors to the assignment
