### **Final Project**

Welcome to the end. You have approximately 3 weeks to do this. This project should be focused on something that interests you. I want you to find something you enjoy and that you will teach me about.

### **Description:**
For your final project, you will design and product a Story Map. This should be seen as an equivalent of writing a final research paper – but using Geospatial Technology instead. The map should be driven by something you find interesting, something you have learned in this class, or based on one of the weird things I’ve babbled about in class.

Ultimately, the Story Map should show how the implementation of geospatial data and/or technology can enhance the reader’s knowledge and experience on the topic.

**No idea is too big or small! I can assist with getting access to data if required.**

### Goals:
1. Learn how to transfer primary source information into digital map points
1. Create maps and pair them with text to form a compelling narrative argument
1. Communicate information to a wide audience through a shareable digital platform
1. Final thought should include how access to additional geospatial technology could enhance the story map (e.g., LiDAR data to collect building heights, Satellite Imagery over time to see change)

### Storymap Deliverable:
Your Story Map should include:
* At least 8-10 sections, each including a title and narrative text.
* At least 2 sections visually represent geospatial data (e.g., a map! Data you collected!)
* At least one section describing how geospatial technology was used or could be used in support of the narrative.
* Images should be included throughout the Story Map, either of features or supporting the narrative of your Story Map.
* Narrative Text should be brief but informative.
	* In at least half of the sections of text, include your analysis – not just statements of fact! Link to sources where appropriate.
	* Use well-editing writing and aim for 75-150 words in a section.
* Sections should make sense sequentially.
* Readability and visual appeal is important!
* All sources must be hyperlinked within the text block where the claim is made.

### Grading:
The final project will be graded out of **200** points and will be worth 20% of your overall grade.

Grades will be based on the following qualifications (at a minimum):

* Each location has an appropriate image and/or a descriptive textual narrative.
* Collected data is appropriately attributed.
* Collected data is appropriately symbolized.
* Each location is relevant to the chosen topic.
* The textual component is thoroughly researched.
* The importance of space and geography to the topic is clear.
* The map and text is well edited and flows together.
* The map is shared with the instructor and the class.
