# <a id="testpreview"></a>What you'll be tested on (All of the content the whole semester)


# <a id = "01"></a>Week 01 - Foundation
* Space - What is the definition? An area cleared for cultivation. 
* Cultivate - What is cultivation?
* Cassini - A family of scientists or astronomers who revolutionized maps and mapping. 
* Composite of France - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini_map. This map is the first map to be based on a [geodesic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic "Geodesic") triangulation.
* Kriegspiel - A game made to counter Napoleon's use of triangulation and maps.
* Sand Table - Originally in ancient greece, Sand Tables were used for counting. Eventually, they would become a rudimentary board for board games, war games, military training, and are currently used in augmented reality.
* Triangulation - determining the location of where a point is given the angles toward it from a known point.
* Information Age - During the battle of Jena Auerstadt, Hegel, watching the battle, declared Napoleon to be the embodiment of a the spirit of an age. Later, Foucault would call this the age of empiricism and later, it would be called the age of information.
* Geospatial - from [here](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/geospatial#:~:text=%3A%20consisting%20of%2C%20derived%20from%2C,spatial%20(or%20geospatial)%20mining.): consisting of, derived from, or relating to data that is directly linked to specific geographical locations. If the data set consists of geographical information, it is called spatial (or geospatial) mining.

# <a id = "02"></a>Week 02 - How do Maps Work?
- Bar Scale - representative distance in reference to scale of a map (e.g. 1" = 1mil).
- compass - [https://support.esri.com/en-us/gis-dictionary/compass](https://support.esri.com/en-us/gis-dictionary/compass)
- Conformal Map - a type of map where angles, scales, and shapes on a map are preserved rather than adapted for the projection.
- direction - [https://support.esri.com/en-us/gis-dictionary/direction](https://support.esri.com/en-us/gis-dictionary/direction)
- distance (or scale) - [https://support.esri.com/en-us/gis-dictionary/scale](https://support.esri.com/en-us/gis-dictionary/scale)

- Map Scale - [https://support.esri.com/en-us/gis-dictionary/scale](https://support.esri.com/en-us/gis-dictionary/scale)
- Projection - When laying a globe down on a 2D surface, we have to adjust the shapes and angles of things. For example, we use the Mercator Projection but Authagraph can be a more accurate projection whereas the Gall-Peters Projection is far more equitable and deals with the various ways we've misrepresented information over time.
- Locator / Inset - [https://support.esri.com/en-us/gis-dictionary/inset-map](https://support.esri.com/en-us/gis-dictionary/inset-map)

# <a id = "04"></a>Week 04 - Game Maps

- Game Cartography Interface - An interface that affords users the ability to manipulate geographic data.
- Playful Mapping - Taking concepts from games and using them in similar ways with actual geographic information.
- Maps of Fictional Places - All maps are essentially maps of fictional places as in reality we need to be there to carry forward the idea of reality. That said, a map is often one artifact that is essential for making a place feel more real.
- Avalon Hill - This is a company that was essential for the development of both Dungeons and Dragons but also maps for tabletop games and really just popular culture mapping.
- Outdoor Survival - This is a game that isn't really a game. Instead, it was a best seller because the first edition of Dungeons and Dragons recommended its purchase for the map it contained.
- Dungeons and Dragons - This is a game that matches imaginary play developed across the decades of war and the World Wars with individual, officer rules for games that began being developed after the battles of Jena and Auerstadt. Strategos, developed by an American, is the US version of another game called Kriegspiel.
- Play on Map - When we began working on games and developing video games, the most logical thing was to work on the map that was included in the box with games.
- Draw Map on Paper - Eventually, we began to hide the map and play involved drawing it while exploration was happening.
- 3D and Maps - As games developed a z-axis, we began to be able to create terrain that was 3dimensional. To deal with this, we began to import developments of maps from the outside.

# <a id = "06"></a>Week 06 - Intro to Geospatial Analysis

- Geospatial Analysis - a form of computational analysis that uses geographic information, spatial data, location data, and increasingly, high-resolution imagery, computer vision, and other forms of AI to extract structured data that can be used for specific applications and industries. [From here](https://capeanalytics.com/blog/geospatial-analytics-what-is-it-how-can-it-give-you-a-competitive-edge/#:~:text=Geospatial%20analytics%20is%20a%20form,for%20specific%20applications%20and%20industries.)

The basis of GIS from ESRI is Google Maps + Excel at its most basic. However, what this comparison provides is incomplete. To make it more complete, we can say that GIS is _actually_ Google Maps + Excel + the Python Interpreter.

You may wonder how and why Python is involved here and we won't specifically get into this in this course. Instead, we will discuss analyses that have been performed using the full breadth and depth of GIS and talk a little bit about how and what went into those analyses.

For the most part, I have tried to grab a higher level analysis that has data that is available and with the help of a whole lot of tutorials, you could begin an analysis. First and foremost, at least for my time as a sort-of geospatial analyst, we tend to use the data from the United States Census.

Collecting data is enormously expensive and any decisions to study something has to begin with finding or collecting it in some capacity. Here are a few fun repositories:

- [https://data.census.gov/](https://data.census.gov/)
- [https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/?metadata_type=geospatial](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/?metadata_type=geospatial)
- [https://data.world/datasets/geospatial](https://data.world/datasets/geospatial)
- [https://freegisdata.rtwilson.com/](https://freegisdata.rtwilson.com/)

From examining travel patterns in a municipality to trying to figure out where a new Starbucks or Target could go, there is an enormous amount of information out there that folks can crunch to figure this stuff out. We'll briefly go over a few of those things.

### Travel Studies

Every decade or so, municipalities reform their strategic plan. For example, here's Rochester's: [https://www.cityofrochester.gov/rochester2034/](https://www.cityofrochester.gov/rochester2034/)

They then contact a statistics and data gathering firm to perform a study of how people travel in the area. From here, they use the data to identify traffic patterns, where new roads or new subdivisions or strip malls or commercial zones could be located. They'll also look for areas of crime, areas of congestion, and look for ways to deal with them. You can read about a few of these projects here:

### Retailers
Retailers will use GIS for 2 distinct reasons: where to locate a store and where to locate items in a store. There is a TON of work on this from a variety of different spaces.

### Segregation
Most of our work on desegregating and correcting the history of our founding has been policy driven. While policy tends to try and force equity, there's still an absolutely huge amount of work to do. Geospatial analysis can provide us with a literal microscope to evaluate where that work is successful and not. Check out the following:

### Disaster Planning and Mitigation
One of the oversights of humans in general is that we build things with little to no consideration of the world. The world then reminds us that things like water, fire, and earth can create massive problems for anyone nearby. To that end, we've really begun to work in and around the concept of "mitigation" or staging a bunch of resources and preparing for the inevitable events that will impact wherever we are.
