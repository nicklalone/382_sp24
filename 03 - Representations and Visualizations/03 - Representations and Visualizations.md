### Assignment 2
This assignment will see you using StoryMaps. I went over in class how to access StoryMaps but if you need some help figuring them out, please let me know.

For this assignment, please publish your storymap and paste the link in the text submission. 

What I want is the following: 

Select a Prompt (just 1)

1. **Prompt 1:** If you travelled around the world, what are the 10 or more places you'd stop along the way?
2. **Prompt 2:** Tell us, Show us, and locate a trip you went on recently. 

Once you have selected the prompt, i'll be treating this like a checklist (10 points each): 

1. At least 10 locations (on a map of some kind) with images that either you own, or are creative commons.
2. A timeline with pictures of said highlights.
3. At least 3 text blocks.
4. What your favorite part of the trip was. 
5. What you learned from the trip and why.
6. Where you will go next and why.

Your grade will also consist of 20 points devoted to cohesion, grammar/syntax, and if your images are yours or are creative commons / open.
