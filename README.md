### <a id = "cd"></a>Course Description
This course provides a survey of technologies used to represent the earth, collectively referred to as Geospatial Technologies (GTs). Students will gain hands-on experience with GTs, including Global Positioning Systems (GPS), Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Virtual Globes (Google Earth), Imaging, and web 2.0 “mapping mashups.” Students should be comfortable working in PC-based computing environments.

#### <a id = "quiz"></a>Quizzes
These are essentially checks on if you have read the assigned reading or done the assigned preparation for the exercise. Each quiz will be released the week before it is due and will be due up to 10 minutes into the class. It will vary.
#### <a id = "ex"></a>Exercises
Exercises are essentially an application of what we are doing that week. I have separated these exercises into 2 categories: 

* Solo Work
* Group Work

For Group Work, you will organize yourselves and distribute work among the entirety of the class. Each exercise is due just before the first day of the next week. For those assignments that are meant to be group-based, you will be having 1 student in the class to submit the assignment. 

For the solo work, the assignment is due just before the first day of the next week's class. 

Each assignment will have its own parameters for the deliverable but generally will be a PDF you upload to the assignment dropbox. At times, it will be a URL submission (typically for Storymaps.)

*One thing to be sure of is to get good at taking screenshots natively on your operating system.*
#### <a id = "test"></a>Test
Each week introduces a number of concepts and there will be a running tally of said concepts. When the end of the semester comes, I will assemble those running tallies and this will form the test review sheet. 

The test itself will essentially be out of 200 points. The result is that we have weeks 2-8, and 10-12 to worry about or 10 weeks of content. You can expect around 10 questions per week at 2 points each (resulting in 100 questions worth 2 points each) and these will range the whole gamut of questions you are familiar with in tests. It will also include a few short answer / essay questions.

Each student will get 3 attempts to take the exam.
#### <a id = "fp"></a>Final Project
For your final project, you will design and product a Story Map. This should be seen as an equivalent of writing a final research paper – but using Geospatial Technology instead. The map should be driven by something you find interesting, something you have learned in this class, or based on one of the weird things I’ve babbled about in class.

Ultimately, the Story Map should show how the implementation of geospatial data and/or technology can enhance the reader’s knowledge and experience on the topic.
