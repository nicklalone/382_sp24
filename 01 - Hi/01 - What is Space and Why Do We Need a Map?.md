# <a id = "day1"></a>Day 1 - The Deal
It is said that, "...the human being is always and necessarily conditioned in his life by his behaviour in relation to a surrounding space." - Bollnow

But what does this mean? Well, we can take another quote to poke at this particular concept. Let's see it: 

`"space is linked as a correlative to the human being living in it again emerges from the fact that it is not only different for different individuals, but also changes for the individual according to his specific state of mind and mood. Every change 'in the human being entails a change to his lived space. DÃ¼rckheim stresses: 'concrete space is different according to the being whose space it is, and according to the life that takes place in it. It changes with the person who conducts humself in it, changes with the topicality of certain attitudes and orientations which - more or less immediately - dominate the whole self."
