# <a id = "day1"></a>Day 1 - The Deal
Hi, how are you. 
I have a number of philosophies about how classes should work. They are relatively simple: 
1. I will present you with a number of concepts and rabbit holes
2. You are in charge of your own learning.
3. As such, you will get out of this class what you put into it. 
4. Above all, it is important to know 2 things: 
	1. I will have due dates for most things in class 
	2. If you do not make the due date or do not get the grade you want, redo the assignment. 
5. The only due date will be the last day of the semester during finals week 
	1. For Spring 24, that is going to be May 6 so we can have a couple days for emergencies.
6. I do not give standard grades aside from an A because there is no A+ at RIT. Instead, I give D+, C+. B+, and A. 

This is the meanest I will be: 
	We will do group work and no, I don't care if you set yourselves on fire in protest. Drop the class and move into the woods to your log cabin and start writing proclamations of how humanity should be if you do not want to work with others. This is the tech sector and we *always* work together. So, get used to it. 
# <a id = "day2"></a>Day 2 - What is Space Anyway?
It is said that, "...the human being is always and necessarily conditioned in his life by his behaviour in relation to a surrounding space." - Bollnow

But what does this mean? Well, we can take another quote to poke at this particular concept. Let's see it: 

"...space is linked as a correlative to the human being living in it again emerges from the fact that it is not only different for different individuals, but also changes for the individual according to his specific state of mind and mood. Every change 'in the human being entails a change to his lived space. Dürckheim stresses: 'concrete space is different according to the being whose space it is, and according to the life that takes place in it. It changes with the person who conducts himself in it, changes with the topicality of certain attitudes and orientations which - more or less immediately - dominate the whole self..."

So space is where life happens and who we are and the space we inhabit are linked in ways even philosophy has trouble with. But this course is about geospatial technologies. Why am I bringing this up here?

Well, let's take a moment to separate space into two distinct ...uhhhh....spaces: 

* Lived or Experienced Space 
	* Has a distinct center
	* distinct axes connected to how we humans are and how our bodies work.
	* areas and locations have a qualitative difference (what does this mean?)
	* transitions between space are both flowing and sharply demarcated, thus unstable.
	* Space tends to be finite until we learn to open that space up
	* every location in experienced space is not neutral.
	* As such, every location in experienced space has meaning and significance
	* we cannot separate humans from spaces.

* Mathematical Space
	* Homogenous. (what?)
	* No point distinguished from any other. (what?)
	* No direction distinguished from any other. (what?)

For the former, we can say that this is where life happens. For the later, this is what we do when we're looking at houses on Zillow. I expect X square feet because my family will require it due to x spouse + x children + x extended family. 

But how did we get here. Let's take a moment and thank 2 folks from France, ok, 1 family and 1 person: 
1. Cassini Family: https://www.davidrumsey.com/xmaps10000.html
	1. Father/Son
		1. Jean-Dominique Cassini 
		2. Jacques Cassini 
		3. surveyed the whole of the Paris meridian from Dunkirk to Perpignan; and between 1733 and 1740 
	2. Father son: 
		1. Jacques Cassini
		2. César Cassini 
			1. undertook the first triangulation of the whole country, including a re-surveying of the meridian arc, leading to the publication in 1745 of the first map of France constructed on rigorous principles.
2. Napoleon Bonaparte: 
	1. Realized that this map and its application to the battlefield could change the probability of positive outcomes in war.

And so, we had experienced or lived space as the general approach to everything. With Cassini and Napoleon's work, the concept of space which had been in development for the past couple hundred years, was suddenly applied and measured beyond any capacity it had been. This resulted in the the start of a new age that we are currently living, the age of empiricism or the age of information.

So what does that matter? Well, after Napoleon was defeated, the world had to figure out wtf just happened. One dude, coming out of France, so completely trounced everything that the world could no longer remain the same. Prussia, the most decimated by Napoleon, had a giant amount of work to do. What we saw was two distinct developments: The Sand Table and Kriegspiel.
### Sand Table
One thing I enjoy is this talk from my friend Matthew on Sandtables. Originally, this was how we computed stuff. It was an interactive surface where people would feed an umpire inputs and the umpire would play it out like some sort of pseudo processor. 

If you have time, give this talk a chance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADvm1CuSeyM&ab_channel=GeorgetownUniversityWargamingSociety

### Kriegspiel
